Faces
=====

:cpp:class:`tw_face` is where you build your content for :cpp:class:`TinyWATCH`.
You can display anything you like using the :cpp:func:`tw_face::draw` method, as well as assign :cpp:class:`tw_widget` and :cpp:class:`tw_control` to any face you create.

Faces can be setup to be navigated to each other, via swiping up, down, left and right.
